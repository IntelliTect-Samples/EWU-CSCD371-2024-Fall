# Assignment 3 (EWU-CSCD371-2024-Fall)

## Overview

For this assignment we are going to create a joke generator. For fun we will back it with a real web service that provides jokes. However, Chuck Norris jokes are over-used so we are going to filter those out. The code to retrieve the jokes from the web service is provided for you.
**Please note** This is someone else's web service, please be respectful and avoid spamming it.

## Assignment

For this assignment do the following:

- Create *two* interfaces. One to represent the `JokeService` and one interface to represent outputting the joke to the screen (`Console.WriteLine`). ✔❌
- The `JokeService` will need to have the interface applied to it. ✔❌
- Create an implementation of the output interface that writes out the joke to the console. ✔❌
- Implement the `Jester` class. It should take in both interfaces as dependencies. These dependencies should be null checked. ✔❌
- The `Jester` class `TellJoke()` method should retrieve a joke from the `JokeService`. If the joke contains "Chuck Norris", skip it and get another. The joke should be written to the output dependency. ✔❌
- Unit test the Jester class. Code coverage should be above 90% for this class. Moq will make this significantly easier. ✔❌

## Fundamentals

- Be sure you enable:
  - Nullability for all projects  ❌✔
  - Set `LangVersion` and the `TargetFramework` to the latest released versions available (preview versions optional) ❌✔
  - Ensure that you turn on code analysis for all projects(`EnableNETAnalyzers`) ❌✔
  - Ensure that you turn on treat warnings as errors for all projects ❌✔
  - Ensure that you turn on `CodeAnalysisTreatWarningsAsErrors` ❌✔
  - Ensure that you turn on `EnforceCodeStyleInBuild` ❌✔
- For this assignment, always use `Assert.Equal<T>()` (the generic version)  ❌✔
- **Ensure there are no errors or warnings (including code analysis warnings)** ❌✔
- **All of the above should be unit tested** ❌✔
- **Choose simplicity over complexity** ❌✔
  
## Extra Credit

- Unit test your implementation that writes the joke out to the screen. How hard could it be to unit test a single line method ;)?
- The Geek jokes API that is being used can also return jokes in a JSON format. Update the `JokeService` to retrieve jokes using JSON. `GetJoke` should still return a string.
