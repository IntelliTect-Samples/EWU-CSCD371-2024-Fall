# Assignment

## Overview

For this assignment, we are going to continue with C# object-oriented concept by expanding Assignment2 to use records, value types, enums, and developing well-formed types in general.

## Reading

Read **Chapters 9 - Introducing Structs and Records & Chapter 10 - Well Formed Typed**

## Tasks

- Define a full name record (first, last, middle) handling optional and null appropriately. ✔
  - Provide a comment on the full name record on why you selected to define a value or a reference type and ✔
  - Provide a comment on the full name record on why or why not the type is immutable. ✔
- Define an `IEntity` interface: ✔
  - Add an Id property of type `Guid` that is an init-only setter. ✔
  - Add a Name property that is `string`. ✔
- Define an abstract base class that implements `IEntity` - appropriately choosing to implement the interface explicitly or implicitly. ✔
  - Do not implement the `Name` property in this abstract class. ✔
  - Do force any derived classes to provide an implementation for `Name`. ✔
- Define book, student, and employee records - all with entity capabilities. ✔
  - Choose a thoughtful approach for the value of `Name` for each type of entity. In all cases, there should be no backing field for Name (not even one generated by an automatically implemented property) - consider a calculated property. ✔
  - Provide a comment on each interface **member** in each entity explaining why you implemented it implicitly or explicitly. ✔
  - You should consider the relationship between Student and Employee and refactor the common code shared between them. ✔
  - Given the properties on the full name record, you should consider which entities it makes sense to use it. ✔
  - Test that the equality behavior on these entities behaves as expected. ✔
  - Provide a comment on each interface method explaining why you implemented it implicitly or explicitly.
- Unit test the Storage class using various entities to ensure that there are no bugs.
- Code review (using TODO: comments if there are any issues - which there may not be) all logger-related classes.)
  - Pay special attention to the CreateLogger methods throughout.

## Fundamentals

- Be sure you enable:
  - Enable Nullability for all projects  ✔
  - Set `LangVersion` and the `TargetFramework` to the latest released versions available (preview versions optional) ✔
  - Ensure that you turn on code analysis for all projects(`EnableNETAnalyzers`) ✔
  - Ensure that you turn on `EnforceCodeStyleInBuild` ✔
  - Ensure that you turn on Nullability (`Nullable`) ✔
- **Ensure there are no errors or warnings (including code analysis warnings)** ❌✔
- **All of the above should be unit tested** ❌✔
- **Choose simplicity over complexity** ✔

## Extra Credit

- Refactor your project files to put common properties and/or items into a single file. ❌✔
- Convert `ILogger.CreateLogger` to a generic method. ❌✔
  - Returns the logger classes type that is to be created. ❌✔
  - Has a type parameter for the configuration type ❌✔


## Relevant APIs to know about

[System.IO.Path](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.io.path) IF you find yourself using string operations to build up a file path, stop and look through the members of this static class.

[System.IO.File](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.io.file) A simple class that can handle simple file reads and writes.

## About the Essential C# Class

### Instructors

[Mark Michaelis](https://github.com/MarkMichaelis), and [Benjamin Michaelis](https://github.com/BenjaminMichaelis)

For any general questions, we suggest asking in [EWU-CSCD371-2024-Fall Microsoft Team's Channel](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/channel/19%3APqQNSyljsFKuv1NPEw0n4i7WtfFr_yq2qb-Bw2WaLuU1%40thread.tacv2/General?groupId=aaeb7301-d4ff-4c7b-af53-ea99754316b2&tenantId=37321907-14a5-4390-987d-ec0c66c655cd). This is a great place to collaborate and ask questions of both each other and the instructors. Though you can message people directly, we encourage open discussion on the meeting chat so that others can benefit as well.

You may send an e-mail with questions that are specific to you to <EWU-Instructors@IntelliTect.com>. Examples include:

* a notification that you are bringing pizza for everyone or
* you are dropping the class

#### Online Class

Class will NOT generally be available online.

#### GitHub Information

Please fill out this [Form](https://forms.office.com/r/b02Uv5u0fe) with your GitHub information. This is used by us so we can appropriately grade assignments.

#### Book

* [Essential C# Book Online](https://EssentialCSharp.com)
* Essential C# 12.0 (8th Edition), ISBN-13: 978-0138219512

#### General Information

* [**Grading System**](./Docs/Homework-Grading.md)
* **Office Hours**: Office hours are available before class on Tuesdays and Thursdays starting at 1 PM.  To ensure that an instructor will be available, please schedule an appointment 24-hours beforehand by sending a meeting request email to <EWU-Instructors@IntelliTect.com>.  Alternative times may be available after class upon request.

#### Computer Setup

##### Required

* [.NET latest](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download)

Though most of the coursework will be cross-platform, we will be working on Windows inside of Visual Studio. For the UI portion of the class Visual Studio on Windows will be required.

###### Recommended

* [Visual Studio 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/)
  Version 17.8 or later. The community edition is fine, though we believe most students should have access to higher SKUs with EWU's MSDN (this assumption may be wrong). Lab computers should have Visual Studio Professional (or higher) already installed. When installing, select the **“ASP.NET and web development” workload**.
* [GitHub Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/students)
  There are lots of great development tools and resources. The JetBrains products ReSharper (a plugin for Visual Studio), and Rider (a full C# IDE) are great tools for helping you write better code.
* [GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/invite/bX2Nqsqr)
  Though you can do all of the git interaction from within Visual Studio or on the command line, GitKraken is free for open-source work. It also provides a nice graphical version of the commit history so you can see how various commits and branches relate.

###### Optional

* [Visual Studio Live Share](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/services/live-share/) This lets you easily collaborate with other people on a shared set of code.
* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) This can largely be used as an alternative to Visual Studio. Many of us also use it as our catch-all lightweight text/code editor.
* [GitExtensions](https://gitextensions.github.io/), [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/), (or any other git tool): There are lots of options out there for working with git. If there is a tool you like, use it!

#### Class Video

We will try to record the class so that students can review it at a later time. [Recordings will be available here (Under files in the teams channel)](https://intellitectsp.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/sites/EWU-CSCD371-2024-Fall/Shared%20Documents/General/Class%20Recordings).
Please note:

* **Do not expect or rely on video recordings.**  We are not making any commitment to having video recordings of the class.
* Please keep all videos ***confidential***. These videos are for people enrolled in this class.  No videos or parts of videos may be copied/distributed/shared.
