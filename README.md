# Assignment

The purpose of this assignment is to learn how to work with delegates and lambda expressions. We will define a 
calculator class that stores 4 actions corresponding to +, -, *, /, and multiple. The calculator class will
also support customizable behavior for reading and writing content.

## Instructions

- Create a *Console* project called "Calculate.". ❌✔
- Define a Program Class
  - Define two init-only setter properties, `WriteLine` and `ReadLine`, that contain delegates for writing a line of text and reading a line of text respectively ❌✔
  - Write a test that sets these properties at construction time and then invokes the properties and verifies the expected behavior occurs. ❌✔
  - Set the default behavior for the `WriteLine` and `ReadLine` properties to invoke `System.Console` versions of the methods and add an empty default constructor. ❌✔
- Define a Calculator class ❌✔
  - Define static `Add`, `Subtract`, `Multiple`, and `Divide` methods that have two parameters and return a third parameter. ❌✔
  - Define a read-only property, `MathematicalOperations`, of type `System.Collections.Generics.IReadOnlyDictionary<TKey,TValue>` that:
    - is initialized to a `System.Collections.Generics.Dictionary<<TKey,TValue>` instance that. ❌✔
      - Uses `char` for the key corresponding to the operators +, -, *, and /. ❌✔
      - Has values that correspond with the Add, Subtract, Multiple, and Divide methods. ❌✔
  - Implement a `TryCalculate` method following "TryParse" pattern ❌✔
    - Valid `calculation` expressions include such strings as "3 + 4", "42 - 2", etc. ❌✔
    - If there is no whitespace around the operator, you can assume the `calculation` is invalid and return false. Similarly if the operands are not integers. ❌✔
    - Use `string.Split()`, pattern matching, logical and operators to parse the string in their entirety ❌✔
    - Index into the `MathematicalOperations` method using the operator parsed during pattern matching to find the corresponding implementation and invoke it. ❌✔
- Implement the Program class to instantiate the calculator and invoke it based on user input from the console. ❌✔
- Be sure to use the `WriteLine`/`ReadLine` properties on `Program` for testing the input and output of your program. ❌✔

## Extra Credit

Do one of the following two options (or both if you want extra, extra credit) :)

- Refactor the redirect portion of the `Program` class into 'ProgramBase`
- Move ProgramBase into a ConsoleUtilities assembly to be used in other console-based projects
- Use generics the mathematical operations methods and consider using generic constraints (requires .NET 7.0)

## Fundamentals

- Place all shared project properties into a `Directory.Build.Props` file.
- Place all shared project items into a `Directory.Build.targets` file.
- nullable reference types is enabled  ❌✔
- Ensure that you turn on code analysis for all projects(EnableNETAnalyzers)  ❌✔
- Set LangVersion and the TargetFramework to the latest released versions available (preview versions optional)   ❌✔
- and enabled .NET analyzers for both projects ❌✔
- For this assignment, always use `Assert.AreEqual<T>()` (the generic version)  ❌✔
- All of the above should be unit tested ❌✔
- Choose simplicity over complexity ❌✔
