# Homework Schedule #

* [Homework](Homework-Assignments.md) assignment will be assigned on Tuesday each week.

## Pairing ##

Students are ***HIGHLY*** encouraged to [pair program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming) on assignments. Collaboration is different from copying someone else' work. When collaborating with another student should do the following:
* Only **one** of you should submit the pull request
* In the description explicitly **[mention](https://blog.github.com/2011-03-23-mention-somebody-they-re-notified/)** (just @ their GitHub name) with a comment indicating you collaborated on the assignment.
* If you pair with someone on an assignment, you both need to do a peer review independently on someone elses pull request.
