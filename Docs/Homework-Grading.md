## Pairing ##

Students are ***REQUIRED*** to [pair program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming) on assignments. Collaboration is different from copying someone else' work. When collaborating with another student should do the following:

* Both students **Must** have commits on the PR.
* Only **one** of you should submit the pull request
* In the description explicitly **[mention](https://blog.github.com/2011-03-23-mention-somebody-they-re-notified/)** (just @ their GitHub name) with a comment indicating you collaborated on the assignment.
* Even though you pair with someone on an assignment, you **both** need to do a peer review independently on someone else's pull request.
