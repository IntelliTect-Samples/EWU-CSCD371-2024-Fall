# About the Essential C# Class #

## Instructors ##

[Mark Michaelis](https://github.com/MarkMichaelis), [Grant Erickson](https://github.com/GrantErickson), and [Meg Woodford](https://github.com/mmwoodfo)

For any general questions, we suggest asking in Microsoft Teams. This is a great place to collaborate and ask questions of both each other and the instructors. Though you can message people directly, as much as possible, we encourage open discussion on the meeting chat so that others can benefit as well.

You can also send an e-mail to: EWU-Instructors@IntelliTect.com

## Online Meeting ##

We will be utilizing Microsoft Teams for this class. The link to the meeting will be in the course syllabus on Canvas. You can find additional information for accessing Teams [here](MicrosoftTeams.md)

## Computer Setup ##

### Required ###

* [.NET latest](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download)

Though most of the coursework will be cross-platform, we will be working on Windows inside of Visual Studio. For the UI portion of the class Visual Studio on Windows will be required. 

### Recommended ###

* [Visual Studio 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/)
  Version 17.1 or later. The community edition is fine, though we believe most students should have access to higher SKUs with EWU's MSDN (this assumption may be wrong). Lab computers should have Visual Studio Professional (or higher) already installed.
* [GitKraken](https://gitkraken.keboo.dev/)
  Though you can do all of the git interaction from within Visual Studio or on the command line, GitKraken is free for open-source work. It also provides a nice graphical version of the commit history so you can see how various commits and branches relate.
* [GitHub Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/students)
  There are lots of great development tools and resources. The JetBrains products ReSharper (a plugin for Visual Studio), and Rider (a full C# IDE) are great tools for helping you write better code.

### Optional ###

* [Visual Studio Live Share](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/services/live-share/) This lets you easily collaborate with other people on a shared set of code.
* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) This can largely be used as an alternative to Visual Studio. Many of us also use it as our catch-all lightweight text/code editor.
* [GitExtensions](https://gitextensions.github.io/), [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/), (or any other git tool): There are lots of options out there for working with git. If there is a tool you like, use it!

## Class Video ##

We will try to record the class so that students can review it at a later time. [Recordings will be available here](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/TODO).
Please note:

* **Do not expect or rely on video recordings.**  We are not making any commitment to having video recordings of the class.
* Please keep all videos ***confidential***. These videos are for people enrolled in this class.  No videos or parts of videos should be copied/distributed/shared.
