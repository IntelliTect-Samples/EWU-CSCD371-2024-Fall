# Attendance

Attendance is strongly encouraged to succeed in this class. It is not only important for finding and communicating with your partner for assignments, but also for the quality of knowledge you will get out of this class. (And we'll be grading it.)

### Grading

Attendance will randomly be taken throughout the quarter. We will assign 5 points to each day that we take attendance. However, depending on how many days we take attendance we will multiply this amount to reach 100 points for the final attendance grade.

### Example of attendance grading

Here's how attendance grades might turn out:

Out of the ~20 classes we have, we might pick 4 of them at random to grade attendance. Each of them is initially worth 5 points. After multiplying them to get to a total of 100 points, they are each worth 20 points. To put this in perspective, if you were to get 100% on all 8 assignments, but you missed all graded lectures, you would have an 85% in the class.
